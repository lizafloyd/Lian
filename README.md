##Why did you choose this subject?
We were interested in alternate forms of data binding, and interacting with Mongo.
##How were you first made aware of it?
We Googled it.
##What problem does it solve?
Meteor serves as a unique meeting point for many of the libraries, frameworks, and other dev tools (think sockets) that we have discussed in the last week. It takes a few minutes to become comfortable seeing Angular, Mongoose, and old school class constructors appearing next to each other in the same app, but it allows us as developers to use whatever technologies we want, all at the same time.
##How does it solve the problem (conceptually)?
Meteor essentially plugs all the dev tools into each other. It serves as a virtual space to bridge the gap between a MEAN app and real-time data binding.
##Why does one use it?

##What are the alternatives?

##What is it similar to, if anything?
There are a number of similar frameworks, including vue.js and backbone.  Meteor, unlike most, is a full-stack framework.
##What is the history of this technology?
##Who built it and why?
##Who is maintaining it?
##What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?
##What are the biggest conceptual hurdles (if any) you encountered when researching this?
##What resources do you recommend for interested students?
##What article or forum was most helpful to you in learning this?
##What are 3 interview questions one might be asked about this technology?
